Assumptions
A) You have already checked out the git repo to a data directory like
/data/threeandout
B) You are on the develop branch


Steps To Setup Django Development Environment
1) Run the setup script as the user you want to develop with (make sure you
have sudo privileges with that user):
    ./setup_development_environment.sh
2) It will ask for several pieces of information
  a) Directory to install threeandout (typically /data)
  c) Password for current user to use with sudo commands

3) Go to threeandout/settings/dev.py and change the dburl to your location of choice (typically /data/threeandout/dbs/threeandout.db)
4) Change to your development virtualenv
   workon development
5) export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=threeandout.settings.dev (otherwise you have
to end every django manage.py command with
--settings=threeandout.settings.dev)

6) DO EITHER
  *) Go to root of threeand out and syncdb ->
     python manage.py syncdb 
     Go to /data/threeandout/scraper and run:
     a) python insert_teams.py
     b) python insert_schedule.py
     c) python insert_players.py
  OR
  *) Grab .db file from ops backup and copy to your dburl (typically
/data/threeandout/dbs/threeandout.db
7) Run the server ->
  python manager.py runserver localhost:8000 
8) You are good to go!


Steps to Development after Initial Install
1) workon development
2) export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=threeandout.settings.dev 
3) python manager.py runserver localhost:8000 


Steps to Use the Production NFLDB to Populate the Development Partition
1) Copy over the config.ini from developers and put it in your
$HOME/.config/nfldb/config.ini file
2) workon development
3) export DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE=threeandout.settings.dev 
4) cd /data/threeandout/threeandout/dbhelper
5) python syncdb.py
